# MONETARYCOIN DISTRIBUTION
## MonetaryCoinERO (MERO) and MonetaryCoinCHI (MCHI)

## HOW MANY MERO TOKENS WILL BE AVAIALABLE?

10% of MonetaryCoinERO Tokens will be distributed according to the schedule described herein. At the conclusion of the distribution, 80% of MonetaryCoinERO Tokens will be available for Proof of Stake forging along with any unclaimed coins.

The MonetaryCoinERO Token distribution will take place in two stages, a 7 day stage, and a 173 day stage over a total of 180 days. The first stage of the distribution will start on June 1st, 2018 at 00:00:01 UTC.

112,800,600,000 (112 billion) ERC-20 compatible MonetaryCoinERO (MERO) Tokens will be distributed according to the schedule below:

    MonetaryCoinERO Tokens                                  Sale Schedule

    1. 844,536,898 (844 million)               June 1st, 2018 00:00:01 UTC–June 7th, 2018 12:59:59 UTC
    
Split evenly into 7 consecutive 23 hour periods of 120,648,128 MonetaryCoinERO Tokens each.

    2. 10,436,063,102 (10.4 billion)          June 8th, 2018 00:00:01 UTC–November 28th, 2018 12:59:59 UTC
    
Split evenly into 173 consecutive 23 hour periods of 60,324,064 MonetaryCoinERO Tokens each.

## HOW DOES MERO DISTRIBUTION WORK?
At the end of each 23 hour period referred to above, a set number of MonetaryCoinERO Tokens will be distributed pro-rata amongst all authorized purchasers, based on the total ETH contributed during those periods, respectively, as follows:

MonetaryCoinERO Tokens distributed to the purchaser at the end of the period = a * (b/c)

* a = Total ETH contributed by an authorized purchaser during the period.
* b = Total number of MonetaryCoinERO Tokens available for distribution in the period.
* c = Total ETH contributed by all authorized purchasers during the period.

To participate in the MonetaryCoinERO Token distribution, you will need to send ETH to the Ethereum MonetaryCoinERO distribution smart contract (the “MonetaryCoinERO Distribution Contract”) during a period of your choice. The MonetaryCoinERO Token can only be claimed when such period is completed. The minimum contribution amount is 0.01 ETH.

MonetaryCoinERO Token will automatically be transferred to the Ethereum address used to purchase MonetaryCoinERO Token. MonetaryCoinERO Token can only be claimed after the period pursuant to which you have purchased your MonetaryCoinERO Token has ended.

#### The minimum participation amount is 0.01 ETH. If one sends anything other than ETH to the MonetaryCoinERO Token Distribution Contract, such transaction will be null and void.

## HOW MANY MCHI TOKENS WILL BE AVAIALABLE?

10% of MonetaryCoinCHI Tokens will be distributed according to the schedule described herein. At the conclusion of the distribution, 80% of MonetaryCoinCHI Tokens will be available for Proof of Stake forging along with any unclaimed coins.

The MonetaryCoinCHI Token distribution will take place in two stages, a 7 day stage, and a 173 day stage over a total of 180 days. The first stage of the distribution will start on June 1st, 2018 at 00:00:01 UTC.

173,985,950,000,000 (173,986 billion) ERC-20 compatible MonetaryCoinERO (MCHI) Tokens will be distributed according to the schedule below:

Split evenly into 173 consecutive 23 hour periods of 930,406,150 MonetaryCoinCHI (MCHI) Tokens each.

## HOW DOES MCHI DISTRIBUTION WORK?
The MCHI distribution similar in many respects to the MERO distribution. At the end of each 23 hour period referred to above, a set number of MonetaryCoinCHI Tokens will be distributed pro-rata amongst all authorized purchasers, based on the total ETH contributed during those periods, respectively, as follows:

MonetaryCoinCHI Tokens distributed to the purchaser at the end of the period = a * (b/c)

* a = Total ETH contributed by an authorized purchaser during the period.
* b = Total number of MonetaryCoinCHI Tokens available for distribution in the period.
* c = Total ETH contributed by all authorized purchasers during the period.

To participate in the MonetaryCoinCHI Token distribution, you will need to send ETH to the Ethereum MonetaryCoinCHI distribution smart contract (the “MonetaryCoinCHI Distribution Contract”) during a period of your choice. The MonetaryCoinCHI Token can only be claimed when such period is completed. The minimum contribution amount is 0.01 ETH.

MonetaryCoinCHI Token will automatically be transferred to the Ethereum address used to purchase MonetaryCoinCHI Token. MonetaryCoinCHI Token can only be claimed after the period pursuant to which you have purchased your MonetaryCoinCHI Token has ended.

#### The minimum participation amount is 0.01 ETH. If one sends anything other than ETH to the MonetaryCoinCHI Token Distribution Contract, such transaction will be null and void.

## CONFIGURATION
In order to make sure ETH are sent and received correctly, the following configuration should be considered:

* Browser: Google Chrome
* Wallet: Metamask

# CREATE SECTION TO DESCRIBE THE APP

## WHERE DO I SEND MY ETHEREUM FOR MonetaryCoinERO (MERO)?
The Ethereum address for the MonetaryCoinERO (MERO) token distribution is:

**XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**

### DO NOT SEND ETH FROM AN EXCHANGE. If you send ETH to MonetaryCoinERO Token Distribution Contract from an exchange account, your MonetaryCoinERO tokens will be allocated to the exchange's ETH account and you may never receive or be able to recover your MonetaryCoinERO tokens.

## WHERE DO I SEND MY ETHEREUM FOR MonetaryCoinCHI (MCHI)?
The Ethereum address for the MonetaryCoinCHI (MCHI) token distribution is:

**XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**

### DO NOT SEND ETH FROM AN EXCHANGE. If you send ETH to MonetaryCoinCHI Token Distribution Contract from an exchange account, your MonetaryCoinCHI tokens will be allocated to the exchange's ETH account and you may never receive or be able to recover your MonetaryCoinCHI tokens.

## TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS
The MonetaryCoinERO Token Distribution Contract and the MonetaryCoinCHI Token Distribution Contract each run on the Ethereum network. Please note the following observations particular to the Ethereum network:

### Block Production occurs at Random Times:
On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times. For example, ETH sent to the MonetaryCoinERO Token Distribution Contract in the MonetaryCoinERO Token Distribution Interface should require the transfer of ETH to apply to the entire current period, otherwise the transaction will fail. Likewise, ETH sent to the MonetaryCoinCHI Token Distribution Contract in the MonetaryCoinCHI Token Distribution Interface should require the transfer of ETH to apply to the entire current period, otherwise the transaction will also fail.

### Network Congestion:
The Ethereum network is prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Some individuals may intentionally spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage. Do not assume Ethereum block producers will include your transaction when you want or that your transaction will be included at all. This is a limitation of Ethereum and not the MonetaryCoinERO Token Distribution Contract or the MonetaryCoinCHI Distribution Contract.

### Do not fund Token Distribution Contract from an account you do not control:
Tokens are allocated to the account that sent them. If you send from an exchange or other account that you do not control then you may not be able to claim your MonetaryCoinERO Tokens or MonetaryCoinCHI Tokens without their help.

## COMMAND LINE USAGE
It is assumed that participants have an Ethereum blockchain client installed. If you don't have the client installed, Parity could be a potential alternative.

## POTENTIAL CONFIGURATIONS
One would need the Nix Package Manager to work with the MonetaryCoinERO and MonetaryCoinCHI contracts, respectively, from the command line. These instructions may be applied to attempt to install it, configure it, and then attempt to install a CLI Ethereum helper called Seth:

$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
$ nix-channel --add https://nix.dapphub.com/pkgs/dapphub
$ nix-channel --update
$ nix-env -i seth

Example Commands:

Getting Tokens:

$ seth send -F <ETH_ADDRESS> -G 4600000 --value=$(seth --to-wei <CONTRIBUTION> ETH) <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
"commit()"

Claiming Tokens:

$ seth send -F <ETH_ADDRESS> -G 4600000 <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "withdrawAll()" <ETH_ADDRESS>

**IF YOU INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN BOTH MERO AND MCHI MAKE SURE TO USE THE CORRECT ADDRESS FOR EACH OFFERING.
